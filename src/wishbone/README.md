# Description

This respository includes a number of Wishbone (mostly SPEC B4) compliant logic cores. These typically are just small, simple modules that can be used to build more sophisticated cores; e.g., `sram_interface.v` can be configured as a read-only, write-only, or a read-write port for a SRAM device, and providing support for Pipelined BURST mode Wishbone transactions.
